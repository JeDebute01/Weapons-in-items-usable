# Weapons-in-items-usable

# **I am not a developer!** I tinker and try to create the scripts I need with what I find and my personal knowledge! 
Thanks to Arood for the SQL with WeaponSync and also thanks to someone I forgot on the CFX forum for the piece of code to use!

## Just a small script to put the basic weapons in usable items with possibility to stack them. When a player have the weapon, he not use the item.

When you give it to yourself and use it, it gives you the basic weapon that you can use in the inventory, in the hotbar or in the basic weapon wheel.

# I use H-Notif but you can comment and uncomment for the basic ESX notifications ;)
